          "text1": "1. Please refrain from obstructing player spawns. If a player spawns inside your base, it's mandatory to ensure there's a clear and easy path out of your base for them.\r\n2. Avoid blocking the spawn points for loot crates, beacons, and explorer notes, and do not hinder other players' access to them.\r\n3. Do not engage in cheating or exploiting game bugs or mods. This includes the use of indestructible player-crafted structures to create bottlenecks or alter the fundamental map design.\r\n4. Maintain a respectful and civil environment in global chat and on the server Discord. This extends to aliases and character names, and excessive cursing, racism, or hate speech is not tolerated. If conflicts arise, please take them to private messages.\r\n5. Show sportsmanship and respect towards other players by refraining from griefing, trolling, or harassing them. This includes refraining from stealing from others' containers, killing players and dinosaurs, luring aggressive dinosaurs to someone's base, or interrupting taming processes.\r\n6. Ensure that your tamed dinosaurs do not wander outside of your base.\r\n7. Do not engage in excessive foundation, pillar, or structure placement. Only build where you are actively playing.\r\n8. Bases are limited to only 1 per tribe, 1 outpost is allowed.\r\n9. Please remove taming pens after the tame is done, otherwise they will be wiped upon sight.\r\n10. Help your fellow survivors and contribute to the community <3\r\n",
